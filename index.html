                        Intro To Being Neighborly is a course dedicated to building leadership and relationship development skills through the process of near pear mentorship. At the beginning of the course you'll be matched with your neighbor, a 4th Grader from Killarney Elementary School! Throughout the semester you will spend a minimum of one hour a week with your neighbor. Each week you'll spend this time getting to know your neighbor, Learning to become a positive influence in his or her life and the lives of others.

                            Mentoring is a tried and true method to providing guidance to at-risk youth. Studies conducted by Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development have shown that children with mentors are less likely to develop substances abuse problems later in life, become more adept at handling their emotions, and become more invested in their education and future. A mentor can be a family member, a teacher, an athletic coach, an older sibling, or... a friendly neighbor!

                            In partnership with Killarney Elementary School, we have developed a course that provides at-risk students from Killarney Elementary with positive role models. Through this course, we hope to help Rollins students improve their leadership and relationship development skills, while also building a deeper appreciation for their local community.

                            Neighbors are matched based on shared interests. The interests, strengths, and needs of Killarney students are assesed by faculty through both observation and an interview. Rollins students that have been approved to take the course are interviewed and assessed by their course instructor. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After the assessment process is completed, Killarney faculty will meet with the instructor to create matches. By the third week of the course, neighbors meet each other after school at Killarney.

                            From the moment you meet your neighbor, you will no longer meet in a classroom on campus. Instead, you'll be meeting with your neighbor each week at Killarney, spending one-on-one time with them and acting as a positive influence in their lives.
